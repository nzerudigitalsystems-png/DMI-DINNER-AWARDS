# Railway deployment variables

The repository includes `railway.json` with the static-file build, database migrations, and Gunicorn start command. Railway provides `PORT`; do not set it yourself.

## Required service variables

Add these under your Django service's **Variables** tab:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | `config.settings.production` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | A unique random secret; generate one with `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"` and keep it private. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Reference the PostgreSQL service, for example `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` if the service is named `Postgres`. |

Create a Railway PostgreSQL service and reference its `DATABASE_URL` in the Django service. Without it, Django falls back to SQLite, whose data is not persistent across Railway deployments.

## Domain and CSRF

After creating a public domain for the Django service, set:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` (or your exact host name, without `https://`) |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | `https://${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` (or the full `https://` origin for your custom domain) |

The production settings can infer these from `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`; set them explicitly if you use a custom domain. For multiple hosts or origins, separate values with commas.

## Optional email delivery

The app uses Django's console email backend unless SMTP is configured. Add these to Railway if you want account and notification emails delivered:

| Variable | Typical value |
| --- | --- |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | Your email provider's SMTP host |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | `587` for TLS, or your provider's port |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | SMTP username |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | SMTP password or provider app password; treat as a secret |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` | `True` for STARTTLS, commonly on port 587 |
| `EMAIL_USE_SSL` | `False` for STARTTLS; use `True` only if your provider requires implicit TLS |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | A sender address verified with your email provider |

Use the exact host, port, TLS mode, and sender requirements from your email provider. Do not enable TLS and SSL together.

## Google sign-in

Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in Railway after creating a Google OAuth client. The Google sign-in button appears when both variables are set. Add `https://${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}/accounts/google/login/callback/` as an authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud. For a custom domain, use that domain instead. Local development uses `http://localhost:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/`.

Do not commit real credentials or secret values to the repository. Use Railway's Variables tab for production secrets.
